"""
Python classes are designed such that some of its syntax is analogous to C++
classes.

However, Python classes are much more dynamic and allow for many things which C++
classes do not.

In most cases, Python classes are used with syntax similar to C++ syntax.

However, there are practical cases where the full flexibility of Python classes are used,
and your C++ knowledge breaks.

The faster you learn about how exacly Python classes work, the faster the magic will go away.

The key points are:

- classes and everythin else in Python are objects
- attributes and the dot `.` operator
- __dict__
- bound methods
